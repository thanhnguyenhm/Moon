More than 2 years already! Some has been upgraded and replaced though most of the parts are still working great. 
The most disappointing part is the SSD. Dead in 1 year. I'm using the HDD right now, waiting till black friday to get the Samsung SSD. Silicon Power: avoid at all costs. 
The most expensive part of my PC is now the keyboard. I'm so into mechanical keyboard lately that I bought the Topre Type Heaven, the cheapest Topre in the lineup. If I ever have to replace it, the next one must be the Topre Realforce white. 
The 4-dollar Logitech speaker is still working unexpectedly. Find no reason to replace it. 
Really wanna do dual-monitor right now but it seems hard to find the one that matches my old monitor. 
The AMD works slower than I expect. I should've gone with Intel as I didn't play any new games that require good graphics. RAM, power supply, mainboard and HDD are still doing a good job and not gonna be replaced in at least 5 years hopefully. 
Those are my best investment so far. Most of the parts are still in the same price compared to 2 years ago. Some even goes up! For electronics it's pretty unusual.
