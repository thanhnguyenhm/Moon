More than 2 years already! Some components have been upgraded and replaced although most of the parts are still working great. 

The most disappointing part is the SSD. Dead in 1 year. *Lesson learned*: stay away with unpopular brand and don't trust 100% in Amazon reviews. However, this Black Friday gave me even more than I need.
- I got a deal from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01DUNLMUU/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) for a **750GB SSD from Crucial** for only **$99**, redeemed the Prime coupon $20 off and it was down to $80! Sweetest deal ever.
- Another deal is the **Linksys Cable Modem** for Comcast at **$19.99** on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006IJHK96/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).
- Not really a deal but I won a bid on Ebay for this used **Macbook Pro retina 2012 15 inch** at only $548 shipped. Felt so lucky.

The most expensive part of my PC is now the keyboard. I'm so into mechanical keyboard that I bought the Topre Type Heaven, the cheapest Topre in the lineup.

I had been using it for more than a year and am still loving it. Recently I wanted to try a tactile and click feedback of the Cherry MX Blue Switch so I got a refurbished Corsair K70 Mechanical Keyboard which was on sale for $50. It does look great on my workstation.

The 4-dollar Logitech speaker is still working unexpectedly. Find no reason to replace it. 
Really wanna do dual-monitor right now but it seems hard to find the one that matches my old monitor. 
The AMD works slower than I expect. I should've gone with Intel as I didn't play any new games that require good graphics.
RAM, power supply, mainboard and HDD are still doing a good job and not gonna be replaced in at least 5 years hopefully. 
Those are my best investment so far. Most of the parts are still in the same price compared to 2 years ago. Some even goes up! For electronics it's pretty unusual.
