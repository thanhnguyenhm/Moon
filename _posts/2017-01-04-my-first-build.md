- **APU**: *AMD A10 7700k Kaveri with Radeon R7*.I didn't use an AMD before. However, my intention is to build a budget PC for programming and playing some games like FIFA, I chose this APU, combine CPU and GPU so I could save money :) The A10-7700k deal came unexpectedly at tigerdirect for 30% off while I was tracking the price of A10-6800k and A10-7850k. So cheap that I couldn't resist. 

- **Motherboard**: *Gigabyte F2A88XM-D3H*. The best motherboard compatible with Kaveri based on reviews. This is the only part that I buy with only 10% discount at newegg :( not a good deal, but a great part

- **RAM**: *Kingston Fury HyperX 1866 8GB (4GBx2)*. Discount 20% with Newegg pre-BlackFriday promotion

- **PSU**: *Corsair CX430*. Good price with $20 rebate. Not modular nor semi-modular though. 

- **Case**: *Corsair Graphite 230T* with window side panel and 3 fans with blue led. I bought this one at Amazon with the lowest price in this year. Apply gift card, so I only paid for the tax. 

- **HDD**: *Seagate 1TB* ( it seems the only options are between Western Digital and Seagate, my portable WD failed so I go with Seagate)

- **SSD**: *Silicon Power 128GB*. The lowest price I can find on a 128GB SSD. Not a popular brand, good reviews. 
Monitor: Samsung 23.6 with PLS panel

- **OS**: *Windows 8.1 Pro x64*. Free thanks to Microsoft Dreamspark

- **I/O**: Asus DVD-RW, Logitech speaker, wireless mouse and keyboard.

I'm really happy with every parts that I've chosen and finally it works! It's almost perfect with the budget. However, I still have some things on my wishlist for future upgrade: a graphic card, a better speaker, a backup external HDD and a mechanical keyboard :) maybe on next, next next Black Friday.
